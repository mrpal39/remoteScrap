                "The ToughNet\nTN-G6500 Series M12 managed Ethernet switches are designed for railway\napplications, including rolling stock and wayside installations. The\nswitches use M12 and other circular connectors to ensure tight, robust\nconnections, and guarantee reliable operation in industrial environments\nwhere vibration and shock are commonplace. The TN-G6500 Series Ethernet\nswitches provide 12 Gigabit Ethernet M12 ports; 8 ports support IEEE\n802.3at/af-compliant PoE functionality. These PoE switches are classified\nas power source equipment (PSE); they provide up to 30 watts of power\nper port, and can be used to power IEEE 802.3at/af-compliant powered\ndevices (PDs), such as IP cameras, wireless access points, and IP\nphones. ",
                "The TN-G6500 Series has push-pull\nM12 connectors that are tailor-made for push-pull cables in order\nto facilitate quick installation, and also allow M12 rotary cables\nto be utilized. The 24 to 110 VDC wide power input range and isolated\ndual power inputs not only allow you to use the same type of power\nsource at different sites around the globe, but also increase the\nreliability of your communications system. Furthermore, the -40 to\n70°C operating temperature and IP67-rated enclosure allow deployment\nin harsh environments. The TN-G6512 Series Ethernet switches are compliant\nwith the essential sections of the EN 50155 standard, covering operating\ntemperature, power input voltage, surge, ESD, vibration, power isolation,\nand includes a model with conformal coating to ensure suitability\nfor a variety of industrial applications.",
