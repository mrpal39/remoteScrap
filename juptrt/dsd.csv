WordPress powers nearly half of all websites, and we serve the WordPress product and service ecosystem.</div><div><br/></div><div>Our flagship service is <a href=""https://getellipsis.com/effective-content-marketing/"">Content Growth</a>, our best-in-class done-for-you SEO Content service. We produce ~50 pieces of content per month for clients. All our content aims to achieve a top ranking in Google.</div><div><br/></div><div>As our new Head of Content, you’ll own Content Growth, its growth, and its success. You’ll manage and grow the Content team, and manage and scale the content production process.</div><div><br/></div><div>Content Growth <a href=""https://getellipsis.com/blog/falcon-ai-91-top-10-weglot/"">drives excellent results</a><a href=""https://getellipsis.com/blog/falcon-ai-almost-guarantees-rankings-barn2/"">for our clients</a>. This is powered by the combination of our robust process and our in-house technology. <a href=""https://getellipsis.com/falcon-ai/"">FALCON AI</a> is our proprietary tech we’ve built to make Content Growth so good. This is all designed and built in-house. FALCON AI was <a href=""https://getellipsis.com/blog/ellipsis-falcon-ai-new-york-times/"">featured in the New York Times</a> earlier this year, and is patent pending.</div><div><br/></div><div>As our new Head of Content, you’ll both leverage and shape the future of FALCON AI to power Content Growth. We are a process driven company, and leverage a lot of robotic process automation to make content production easier. You’ll also leverage and shape this.</div><div><br/></div><div>Our content team consists of Content Managers, who own the work and relationship with their clients, and Content Specialists, who help with the process. This is currently a team of 3, and you’ll lead this team. All of the content team will report directly to you. An important part of this role will be nurturing the existing team, and hiring and onboarding new team members into both roles or any new ones we identify we may need.</div><div><br/></div><div>Our content process is a mature and (fairly) well-documented production workflow. As Head of Content, you’ll own this process and drive improvements in all areas. You’ll identify and improve weak spots, own OKRs and KPIs for content production quality and outcomes, and ensure Content Growth remains the best-in-class solution for our clients.</div><div><br/></div><div>SEO requirements are taken care of by our Strategy team. You’ll own the overall SEO results from Content Growth, and will work closely with the Strategy team to ensure continual improvement here. You’ll also liaise with Sales and the Managing Director to understand content capacity needs, plan hiring, and set budgets.</div><div><br/></div><div>We currently serve ~15 clients on Content Growth and produce 60+ posts/month. We plan to significantly scale this in the next year, and as Head of Content you will drive this.</div><div><br/></div><div>Success in this role will require getting fully immersed and up to speed with Content Growth in your first 6 months, and then at least doubling Content Growth’s revenue and team in the next 12 months. It’s an exciting period for Ellipsis, and we’re looking for the right person to take the team through this critical period.</div><div><br/></div><div>Ellipsis is a 100% remote company, and always has been. We’re based across Europe, and regularly meet for team meetups and conferences. We’re aiming to become a B Corp in 2022.</div><div><br/></div><div>The Head of Content reports directly to the Managing Director, and will join our Senior Management team. This is an exciting opportunity to join a growing company doing great work and working on interesting challenges at a time when you can influence and help shape its future.</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>This position can be broken down as follows: </strong></div><div><br/>50% Leadership and management of the content team and process</div><div>25% Strategic planning and reporting</div><div>25% Client work on your own clients</div><div><br/></div><div><strong>You will own Content Growth, the content team, and the content process. </strong>You’ll be responsible for the overall success and growth of Content Growth. To support the above, you need the following skills:</div><div><br/></div><ul><li><strong>Leadership: </strong>success in the Head of Content role will have a huge impact on the business. You have the opportunity to build and lead a world-class team as we scale.<br/><br/>This will require both nurturing and leading the existing content team, growing the team, and ensuring Content Growth remains a best-in-class service for clients (both client experience and client outcomes).<br/><br/>You’ll also be part of our Senior Management team, where we shape the future of the business and get peer support to make the best possible decisions.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Data and analytics: </strong>you’ll be dealing with both production and analytics data, and KPIs coming out of these.<br/><br/>We plan our capacity across Google Sheets and Tableau; you’ll own the updating and improvement of this setup, and leverage it to ensure we have a bottleneck-free production workflow that can deliver work on-time and on-budget <em>and</em> can meet our hiring/sales needs.<br/><br/>We collect a lot of data for each Content Growth client; as you’ll be responsible for overall outcomes from Content Growth, you should be happy triaging and analysing this data to get the insights we need to improve.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Content and clients: </strong>whilst we’re a growing team, we’re still a small company (10 people). In small companies, it’s a necessity to wear many hats. Whilst you’ll spend most of your time leading the content team, you’ll also have your own clients where you’re the project lead.<br/><br/>You should be happy being in the weeds doing client work, talking to your clients, and doing great content work. We find this also goes a long way to give the role a deep sense of understanding of what should be improved.</li></ul><div><br/></div><div><strong>Requirements: hard skills <br/></strong><br/></div><ul><li><strong>You either have experience as a Head of Content or similar, or you can demonstrate you're ready to step into this role</strong>.

You will be the ultimate point of escalation for both team members who need help, and clients who need problems solved.</li><li>Strong understanding of SEO Content production, going beyond writing. You understand what research and effort is needed for great rankings, and have had experience experimenting with different techniques which have given results.</li><li><strong>Impeccable English editorial skills</strong>. You’re the ultimate escalation point for grammar and editorial questions!</li><li><strong>Hunger for data and analytics</strong>. We use Google Sheets, Tableau, and Airtable to manage our internal content analytics; working with these to improve outcomes should excite you.</li><li>Project and production management. With ~60 posts/month – and that number increasing on your watch – content production must go smoothly. You’ll both keep abreast of the project management, and continually identify and remove bottlenecks in the production process.</li><li>Availability to work on European time (GMT/CET). The content team is based in Europe. Realistically, being based in the UK or EMEA is a significant advantage; we are however happy to consider candidates with significant overlap with European working hours.</li></ul><div> </div><div><strong>Requirements: soft skills<br/></strong><br/></div><ul><li><strong>Fantastic communication skills: </strong>Leadership in remote work relies on mutual trust, so frequent and clear written communication is essential.</li><li><strong>High level of self-awareness:</strong> Ellipsis will harness all of your experience to improve Content Growth; you’ll in turn have a lot to get up to speed with and will need to have the self-awareness to understand where to push for improvements and where to defer.</li><li><strong>Proven organisational skills: </strong>Content Growth is a complex production process, and it’ll get more complex on your watch as we scale. You must be extremely organised. You’ll need to be up to speed with all of our content work day-to-day, alongside the leadership and management requirements of the role.</li><li>Effective prioritisation: The scope for this role is wide! You’ll need to juggle your different responsibilities and the priorities of the business. You’ll need to understand the tradeoff of different tasks, and delegate and prioritise effectively to make them happen.</li><li><strong>Self-driven work ethic: </strong>This role requires you to take on board a lot of information about how Content Growth our clients work to start, and then you’ll have a lot of autonomy to run the Content team.You need to be self-motivated.</li></ul><div> </div><div><strong>Bonus points if you have:</strong></div><ul><li>Experience in a remote-work environment</li><li>Digital marketing agency experience</li><li>WordPress industry experience (we’re very happy to train for this if you don’t)</li><li>Advanced skills in Google Sheets, Excel, and/or Airtable</li><li>Deeper SEO expertise beyond basic keyword research</li></ul><div><br/><strong>Compensation and benefits: </strong></div><ul><li>This is a full-time, 100% remote role.

The following values underpin this. You should embody these traits. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>2 -</strong><strong>Direct &amp; honest communication (transparency)</strong> – to be successful we have to face the truth and be honest. And that starts with each other. That means we give direct feedback. We want it in exchange. So feel free to argue your points, just be ready to get onboard with decisions once they are made. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>3 -</strong><strong>Ownership &amp; Accountability</strong> – the best people are the ones who OWN their position, tasks and even things that go beyond their 'day-to-day responsibilities'. They never say, “that’s not my job.” Instead, they proactively spot problems and always try to think like the owner of the business. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>4 - Intelligence and smarts</strong> – we prize smart people. Who doesn’t? But it's not just book smarts but “business smarts” where you’re able to solve problems. Think for yourself. And don't be intimidated by any problem, no matter how complex. (Aka growth mindset). </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>5 - Self-aware (personal growth)</strong> – we want people who can look at themselves objectively, admit their mistakes and be open to growth. When you bring this attitude to your profession, it becomes a place of personal development and self-actualization. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>6 - Integrity</strong> – trust is the glue that holds us together. We need to be able to trust you whether it is regarding the quality of your hours, the deadlines you set for yourself or anything else. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>7- Urgency </strong>– we’re a startup and you need to be able to meet deadlines. We need someone who pushes themselves when they need to and hits deadlines. And also knows how to prioritize the important things. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>8 - Hard working</strong> – we’re trying to get shit done on a budget. If you’re looking for an easy job, go elsewhere. Instead, this job will constantly have challenges and opportunities to learn and grow professionally. But we try to have fun while we’re doing it and consider each other friends. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>9 - Data</strong> – whenever possible, we want to make decisions based on data, not emotions or opinions. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>10 - No assholes</strong> – Doesn’t matter how good someone is at their job, if they are going to make life suck for other people on the team, then they aren’t welcomed at Vidalytics.</div><div><br/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Cheers,</div><div>👨🏻‍🦲</div><div>Patrick Stiles </div><div>Founder / CEO @ Vidalytics</div></div>","a:1:{s:3:""url"";s:76:""https://forms.clickup.com/2375967/f/28g8z-5627/YJVGTLTPLMAML0UR88?Source=WWR"";}","Vidalytics","https://forms.clickup.com/2375967/f/28g8z-5627/YJVGTLTPLMAML0UR88?Source=WWR","https://forms.clickup.com/2375967/f/28g8z-5627/YJVGTLTPLMAML0UR88?Source=WWR",,,,,,,,,,

Levelheadedness</strong>: We should be calm, considered, and thoughtful in our dealings with each other and the world at large. We don't act out of spite, we don't rush to judgment, we don't jump to conclusions. If someone disagrees with us or attacks us we listen, we think, and we respond calmly and clearly - directly addressing the idea or the situation, not the personality or the pressure.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>3. Improve consistently</strong>: Trying new things, failing fast and iterate is part of our DNA. We understand that everything that we do is a constant iteration. One day we celebrate the success of something we launched and the next day we think about how to make it 3x better. We try to make radical improvements, not make something better by 5%. Every process, every product, every sentence on the website can be improved. We believe in fast iteration and constantly searching for customer feedback.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>4. Be your weird self</strong>: We are a diverse team of different nationalities, living in different places. It's part of our culture and we try to leverage it. Each member of the team brings unique value to our product and the way we work.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>5. Remote by default</strong>: Working in a remote team requires specific skills: We always try to be self-sufficient, take initiative and be creative in using technology. This also applies to the product we are building. When coming up with solutions we think about how we can remove friction and streamline solutions by providing top-notch virtual service.<br/><br/></li></ul></div>","a:1:{s:3:""url"";s:38:""https://airtable.com/shrqdALQahIf5Uz8s"";}","SurfOffice","https://www.surfoffice.com/","https://www.surfoffice.com/",,,,,,,,,,

We're now expanding our team and looking for a talented copywriter to help us build community at scale with the power of their words.</div><div><br/></div><div>You will be both the catalyst and the amplifier of our community.</div><div><br/></div><div>In this role, you will turn the community strategies that we develop together into impactful messages that resonate with our members and drive action. Every day, you will inspire our members to take on the vision for our community and empower them to move it forward.</div><div><br/></div><div>Your work here will be up-close and personal but also drive impact at scale. You will reach thousands of people with your words and you will build close relationships with our most passionate and supportive members to achieve more, together.</div><div><br/></div><div>What’s different about this community marketing role, is that our community exists both online <strong><em>and</em></strong> in person, all over the world. People will meet and experience the best years of their lives, take on adventures together, build life-long friendships, find a cofounder to finally bring their startup idea to life, learn and grow together, find love, and some will even build families… all because of your work and the words you write.</div><div><br/></div><div>This position is for a savvy marketer, passionate about community, with top-notch copywriting skills. For every hire, we look for new team members that are so brilliant at what they do that they make us nervous working with them.</div><div><br/></div><div>Are you up for the challenge?<br/><br/></div><h1>Who We Are (Our Culture)</h1><ul><li><strong><em>We’re a team.</em></strong> We’re a small, tight-knit team and although we’re fully remote, we take every chance to be together. We look out for one another and cheer each other on.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>We’re obsessed with this community.</em></strong> We have all chosen to join the team, first and foremost, because we love this community; a place where remarkable people from all over the world meet to take on the journey of life together.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>We’re as diverse as the United Nations.</em></strong> Our team of 13 comes from 10 different countries. Many of us have become permanently nomadic global citizens, as we travel the world side-by-side with our members.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>We’re small but mighty.</em></strong> What we don’t have in numbers, we make up for in determination and resourcefulness. We’re nifty, we’re inventive and we don’t give up.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>We are brave.</em></strong> We don’t compromise when it comes to our values, our mission, or who we are. Every member of our team has the courage to stand up for what they believe in and challenge bad ideas. We know that doing the right thing always pays off in the end.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>We care.</em></strong> We take full ownership of our work because we take pride in everything we do. We care about how we show up and who or what we’re becoming. And of course, we care about our teammates and our community members.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>We’re explorers at heart.</em></strong> We’re curious and adaptable, which is why each of us chose to take on this crazy challenge of building a global community and a startup at the same time. Everyone on the team has lived, worked, and travelled with the Tribe for at least a month – some of us for years. Joining this team means embarking on the biggest adventure of your career… but don’t worry, you’re in good company.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>We lead with humility.</em></strong> We don’t compete for wealth, titles, or status; we’re driven by passion and excitement for our mission. There is no space for big egos here.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>We treat people right.</em></strong> There is never a good enough reason to treat someone without dignity and respect. We challenge ourselves to treat others the way they would want to be treated.<br/><br/></li></ul><h1>Who You Are</h1><ul><li><strong><em>You’re a community builder. </em></strong>You know that community is the next big thing in marketing and this excites you because you know you’ve got a talent for it.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>You intuitively know how others feel.</em></strong> You’ve realised that you are naturally gifted at understanding what other people are feeling and experiencing because you’re able to put yourself in their shoes, whatever their situation may be.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>You have a mind for strategy.</em></strong> You enjoy taking on a challenging goal and working backwards to make it happen. You spend time thinking about how your work fits into the bigger picture and how to achieve your desired outcome.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>You set your own course.</em></strong> As long as you know clearly where you’re going, you know that you’ll be able to figure out how to get there. You don’t wait for someone to tell you what to do.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>You care about the details.</em></strong> You put care and attention into everything you do; your choice of words, the structure of your email, and even the punctuation. You know that the way that you write has a big impact on how the person on the other end feels.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>You always figure it out.</em></strong> No matter how challenging the project, you always find a way to succeed because you don’t give up. You keep digging until you’ve found what you’re looking for.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>You’re a tinkerer.</em></strong> You’re always making improvements, big or small. You can’t sit still because you know that there’s always something that can be made better. You love doing things not just efficiently, but <em>effectively</em>, and to create something that lasts.<br/><br/></li><li><strong><em>You’re a citizen of the world.</em></strong> National boundaries are a human construct.

This is currently a team of 3, and you’ll lead this team. All of the content team will report directly to you. An important part of this role will be nurturing the existing team, and hiring and onboarding new team members into both roles or any new ones we identify we may need.</div><div><br/></div><div>Our content process is a mature and (fairly) well-documented production workflow.

You have the opportunity to build and lead a world-class team as we scale.<br/><br/>This will require both nurturing and leading the existing content team, growing the team, and ensuring Content Growth remains a best-in-class service for clients (both client experience and client outcomes).<br/><br/>You’ll also be part of our Senior Management team, where we shape the future of the business and get peer support to make the best possible decisions.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Data and analytics: </strong>you’ll be dealing with both production and analytics data, and KPIs coming out of these.<br/><br/>We plan our capacity across Google Sheets and Tableau; you’ll own the updating and improvement of this setup, and leverage it to ensure we have a bottleneck-free production workflow that can deliver work on-time and on-budget <em>and</em> can meet our hiring/sales needs.<br/><br/>We collect a lot of data for each Content Growth client; as you’ll be responsible for overall outcomes from Content Growth, you should be happy triaging and analysing this data to get the insights we need to improve.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>Content and clients: </strong>whilst we’re a growing team, we’re still a small company (10 people). In small companies, it’s a necessity to wear many hats. Whilst you’ll spend most of your time leading the content team, you’ll also have your own clients where you’re the project lead.<br/><br/>You should be happy being in the weeds doing client work, talking to your clients, and doing great content work. We find this also goes a long way to give the role a deep sense of understanding of what should be improved.</li></ul><div><br/></div><div><strong>Requirements: hard skills <br/></strong><br/></div><ul><li><strong>You either have experience as a Head of Content or similar, or you can demonstrate you're ready to step into this role</strong>.

You will be the ultimate point of escalation for both team members who need help, and clients who need problems solved.</li><li>Strong understanding of SEO Content production, going beyond writing. You understand what research and effort is needed for great rankings, and have had experience experimenting with different techniques which have given results.</li><li><strong>Impeccable English editorial skills</strong>.

The following values underpin this. You should embody these traits. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>2 -</strong><strong>Direct &amp; honest communication (transparency)</strong> – to be successful we have to face the truth and be honest. And that starts with each other. That means we give direct feedback. We want it in exchange. So feel free to argue your points, just be ready to get onboard with decisions once they are made. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>3 -</strong><strong>Ownership &amp; Accountability</strong> – the best people are the ones who OWN their position, tasks and even things that go beyond their 'day-to-day responsibilities'. They never say, “that’s not my job.” Instead, they proactively spot problems and always try to think like the owner of the business. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>4 - Intelligence and smarts</strong> – we prize smart people. Who doesn’t? But it's not just book smarts but “business smarts” where you’re able to solve problems. Think for yourself. And don't be intimidated by any problem, no matter how complex. (Aka growth mindset). </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>5 - Self-aware (personal growth)</strong> – we want people who can look at themselves objectively, admit their mistakes and be open to growth. When you bring this attitude to your profession, it becomes a place of personal development and self-actualization. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>6 - Integrity</strong> – trust is the glue that holds us together. We need to be able to trust you whether it is regarding the quality of your hours, the deadlines you set for yourself or anything else. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>7- Urgency </strong>– we’re a startup and you need to be able to meet deadlines. We need someone who pushes themselves when they need to and hits deadlines. And also knows how to prioritize the important things. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>8 - Hard working</strong> – we’re trying to get shit done on a budget. If you’re looking for an easy job, go elsewhere. Instead, this job will constantly have challenges and opportunities to learn and grow professionally. But we try to have fun while we’re doing it and consider each other friends. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>9 - Data</strong> – whenever possible, we want to make decisions based on data, not emotions or opinions. </div><div><br/></div><div><strong>10 - No assholes</strong> – Doesn’t matter how good someone is at their job, if they are going to make life suck for other people on the team, then they aren’t welcomed at Vidalytics.</div><div><br/><br/></div><div><br/></div><div>Cheers,</div><div>👨🏻‍🦲</div><div>Patrick Stiles </div><div>Founder / CEO @ Vidalytics</div></div>","a:1:{s:3:""url"";s:76:""https://forms.clickup.com/2375967/f/28g8z-5627/YJVGTLTPLMAML0UR88?Source=WWR"";}","Vidalytics","https://forms.clickup.com/2375967/f/28g8z-5627/YJVGTLTPLMAML0UR88?Source=WWR","https://forms.clickup.com/2375967/f/28g8z-5627/YJVGTLTPLMAML0UR88?Source=WWR",,,,,,,,,,

Levelheadedness</strong>: We should be calm, considered, and thoughtful in our dealings with each other and the world at large. We don't act out of spite, we don't rush to judgment, we don't jump to conclusions. If someone disagrees with us or attacks us we listen, we think, and we respond calmly and clearly - directly addressing the idea or the situation, not the personality or the pressure.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>3. Improve consistently</strong>: Trying new things, failing fast and iterate is part of our DNA. We understand that everything that we do is a constant iteration. One day we celebrate the success of something we launched and the next day we think about how to make it 3x better. We try to make radical improvements, not make something better by 5%. Every process, every product, every sentence on the website can be improved. We believe in fast iteration and constantly searching for customer feedback.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>4. Be your weird self</strong>: We are a diverse team of different nationalities, living in different places. It's part of our culture and we try to leverage it. Each member of the team brings unique value to our product and the way we work.<br/><br/></li><li><strong>5. Remote by default</strong>: Working in a remote team requires specific skills: We always try to be self-sufficient, take initiative and be creative in using technology. This also applies to the product we are building. When coming up with solutions we think about how we can remove friction and streamline solutions by providing top-notch virtual service.<br/><br/></li></ul></div>","a:1:{s:3:""url"";s:38:""https://airtable.com/shrqdALQahIf5Uz8s"";}","SurfOffice","https://www.surfoffice.com/","https://www.surfoffice.com/",,,,,,,,,,
