                "The UPort® 200A Series general-purpose USB 3.2 hubs can expand an\nUSB port into 4 or 7 USB ports. The hubs are designed to provide true\nUSB 3.2 Gen 1 SuperSpeed 5 Gbps data transmission rates through each\nport. The hubs are fully compliant with the USB plug-and-play spec\nand provide full 900 mA power per port, ensuring that your USB devices\nfunction properly. Externally powered USB hubs are the only way to\nguarantee the broadest compatibility with USB devices.",
                "The UPort® 200A Series hubs has BC 1.2 compatible on\nport 1, which would provide 1.5 A charging power to the mobile device/power\nbank that also supports BC 1.2.  The UPort® 200A Series supports CDP,\nDCD and SCD type.",
                "Electrostatic discharge (ESD) could be as severe as having\nmore than 1,000 volts of ESD with a high rise-time (dv/dt) breaking\nthrough the junction layer of protective devices. In order to avoid\nserious damage, Moxa’s UPort® 200A Series USB hubs provide ESD Level\n4 (contact 8 kV, air 15 kV) protection, which increases the quality\nand value of the user’s end product."
