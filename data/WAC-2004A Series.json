                "The goal of zero-latency roaming is to allow clients\nto seamlessly maintain their connection as they move from one access\npoint to another. Moxa's WAC-2004A Industrial Wireless Access Controller\nfeatures Controller-based Turbo Roaming technology to enable millisecond-level\nroaming across different IP subnets. The advanced roaming algorithm\nalong with Mobile IP technology allows wireless clients to roam between\nAPs in different IP subnets within milliseconds, while upholding stringent\nsecurity in extremely demanding environments. The rugged WAC-2004A\nis capable of operating at temperatures of 0 to 50°C and is suitable\nfor on-site installation in harsh industrial environments. ",
