The IP68 housing allows the unit to withstand\nharsh weather conditions, and the M12 connectors make the unit shock\nand vibration resistant. The TAP-323 supports advanced controller-based\nTurbo Roaming technology for train-to-ground wireless applications\nsuch as communication-based train control (CBTC) and CCTV. The unit\ncan supply power to up to 4 PoE devices while providing reliable LAN\ncommunication with Moxa’s Turbo Chain technology.",
