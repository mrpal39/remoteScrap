                "The TSN-G5008\nSeries switches are ideal for making manufacturing networks compatible\nwith the vision of Industry 4.0. The switches are equipped with 8\nGigabit Ethernet ports and up to 2 fiber-optic ports. The full Gigabit\ndesign makes them a good choice for upgrading an existing network\nto Gigabit speed or for building a new full-Gigabit backbone for future\nhigh-bandwidth applications. The compact design and user-friendly\nconfiguration interfaces provided by the new Moxa web GUI make network\ndeployment much easier. In addition, future firmware upgrades of the\nTSN-G5008 Series will support real-time communication using standard\nEthernet Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN) technology."
