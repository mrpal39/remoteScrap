                "The ToughNet\nTN-G4500 Series M12 managed Ethernet switches are designed for railway\napplications, including rolling stock and wayside installations. These\nswitches are equipped with M12 and similar circular connectors to\nensure tight, robust connections, and guarantee reliable operation\nin industrial environments where vibrations and shock are commonplace.\nThe TN-G4500 Series Ethernet switches provide 4 10G Ethernet M12 ports\nwith PoE functionality, 16 Gigabit Ethernet M12 ports, and 8 ports\nwith PoE functionality. These PoE switches are classified as power\nsource equipment (PSE), capable of providing up to 30 watts of power\nper port to IEEE 802.3at/af-compliant powered devices (PDs), such\nas IP cameras and wireless access points.",
                "The TN-G4500 Series has M12 connectors that are tailor-made for push-pull\ncables to facilitate quick installation and allow M12 rotary cables\nto be utilized. The 24 to 110 VDC wide power input range and isolated\ndual power inputs not only allow you to use the same type of power\nsource at different sites around the globe, but also increase the\nreliability of your communications system. Furthermore, the -40 to\n70°C wide operating temperature range allows deployment in harsh environments.\nThe TN-G4500 Series complies with the essential sections of the EN\n50155 standard, covering operating temperature, power input voltage,\nsurge, ESD, vibration, power isolation, and features models with conformal\ncoating to ensure suitability for a variety of industrial applications.",
