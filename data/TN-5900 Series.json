                "The ToughNet TN-5900 Series, designed for rolling stock backbone networks, are high-performance M12 routers with four bypass relay backbone ports. They support NAT and routing functionality to facilitate the deployment of applications across networks. The TN-5900 Series routers use M12 and other circular connectors to ensure tight, robust connections that guarantee reliability against environmental disturbances, such as vibration and shock.",
                "The TN-5900 Series routers provide a wide power input range of 24 to 110 VDC. TN-5900 Series switches operate in an extended operating temperature range of -40 to 75°C and are compliant with the mandatory requirements of EN 50155/50121-4, making them suitable for a variety of industrial applications.",
                "Routing functionality to divide a large network into hierarchical subnets and allow data and information to communicate across networks",
