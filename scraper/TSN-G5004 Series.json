                "The TSN-G5004\nSeries switches are ideal for making manufacturing networks compatible\nwith the vision of Industry 4.0. The switches are equipped with 4\nGigabit Ethernet ports. The full Gigabit design makes them a good\nchoice for upgrading an existing network to Gigabit speed or for building\na new full-Gigabit backbone for future high-bandwidth applications.\nThe compact design and user-friendly configuration interfaces provided\nby the new Moxa web GUI make network deployment much easier. In addition,\nfuture firmware upgrades of the TSN-G5004 Series will support real-time\ncommunication using standard Ethernet Time-Sensitive Networking (TSN)\ntechnology."
